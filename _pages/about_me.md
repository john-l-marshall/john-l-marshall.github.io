I grew up in Brighton on the south coast of England, and have since lived in Oxford, London, Washington DC, Boston, and now New York City. 

Before joining Columbia, I received a PhD in Government at Harvard in 2016, an MSc in Politics Research (Comparative Politics) at Nuffield College, University of Oxford in 2010, and a BA at St Anne's College, University of Oxford in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 2008. I previously worked as a civil servant at the House of Commons Library, the British equivalent of the U.S. Congressional Research Service.

In my spare time I play and watch football and try to explore the world. I am still hoping [Watford FC](https://www.watfordfc.com/) will return to (relative) greatness (latest: this is not progressing well). 

<!--- My partner [Rakeen Mabud](https://groundworkcollaborative.org/person/rakeen-mabud) is Chief Economist and Senior Fellow at the Groundwork Collaborative. You should check out her important work! My daughter is more focused on standing up. -->
