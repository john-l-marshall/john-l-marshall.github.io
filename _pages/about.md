Welcome!

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy, and spans elections in developing and developed contexts. More specifically, I study how news consumption, indicators of government performance, levels of education, and social networks shape how voters select politicians. As well as bottom-up voter behavior, I'm also interested in how politicians choose electoral strategies, when media outlets decide to report political news, and how institutions can be designed to improve bureaucratic performance. I generally analyze these questions by combining quasi-experimental and experimental designs with theoretical models to identify and help interpret causal relationships. My research has been published, or is forthcoming, in journals including the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>Journal of the European Economic Association</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, and <i>Review of Economics and Statistics</i>.
