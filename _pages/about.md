Welcome to my website!

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, political communication, and political economy, focusing primarily on developing contexts. I study how news consumption, media formats, levels of education, and social networks shape how voters select politicians and hold them accountable. As well as voter behavior, I study what news media outlets report (or not) and the consequences for governance, the trade-offs shaping government repression of the media, and how media markets and other institutions can be designed to improve government service delivery. I typically analyze these questions by combining quasi-experimental and experimental evidence with theoretical models to identify and then interpret causal relationships. <!-- My research has been published in the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Journal of the European Economic Association</i>, <i>Review of Economics and Statistics</i>, and <i>Science Advances</i>. -->
