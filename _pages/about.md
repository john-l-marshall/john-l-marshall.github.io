Welcome to my website!

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy, and focuses primarily on developing contexts. I study how news consumption, different types of media, levels of education, and social networks shape how voters select politicians and hold them accountable. As well as bottom-up voter behavior, I study what types of news media outlets report (or not) and the consequences for governance, when governments repress the media, and how media markets and other institutions can be designed to improve government service delivery. I typically analyze these questions by combining quasi-experimental and experimental designs with theoretical models to identify and help interpret causal relationships. My research has been published, or is forthcoming, in journals including the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>American Political Science Review</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Journal of the European Economic Association</i>, and <i>Review of Economics and Statistics</i>.
